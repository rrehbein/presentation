Example:
    The `isEmpty()` method enables search engines that use the service to determine
    that there's no search.

    ...

    The class has two properties, both of which are private and boolean:
    `$keywordsEmpty` and `$categoriesEmpty`. They're declared as `TRUE`, and are
    set to `FALSE` only if the search specified some keywords or categories,
    respectively.

The person who is best qualified to write documentation is also the person who has the least motivation for doing so:
he (or she) is:
* primarily a maintainer of the library, rather than a user. So the smaller and simpler the library is, the easier his job. Maintaining half a novel in addition to the code only makes his job harder,
* he knows the library inside out, so he doesn't need the documentation,
* he's a programmer, he wants to write code, not documentation.
I can't think of anyone who's less likely to go "Hmm, I really should spend a few hours writing some proper documentation for this". Why would he?
And of course, it probably doesn't help that there's this urban legend going around that autogenerated doxygen-style comments are all you need in terms of documentation.
So even in the rare cases where a developer is actually willing to write documentation, it's a 50/50 chance that the developer has been brainwashed by this cult into thinking that all that is needed is filling out a few such comments, telling you gems like that "the function Foo getFoo() returns an object of type Foo, and it is used to get the Foo object".
